# scrabbleWords
scrabble word finder using a hash tables

This is now running as a flask app (albeit with zero formatting)
Simply download install packages and python run.py

The program will first pull dictionary.csv into a hash table with the sorted word as the key and the value as a list of words

This allows constant time access to the anagrams of a word being searched.
